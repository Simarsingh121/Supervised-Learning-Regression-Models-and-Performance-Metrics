        "\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "- Simple Linear Regression (SLR) is a statistical technique used to describe the relationship between two continuous variables – one independent (predictor) variable and one dependent (response) variable. It assumes that this relationship can be represented by a straight line. The main purpose of SLR is to predict the value of the dependent variable based on the independent variable and to understand how the two variables are related. It helps in both prediction and interpretation, showing how much change in one variable affects the other.\n",

        "Answer:\n",
        "- The key assumptions of Simple Linear Regression are:\n",
        "\n",
        "Linearity: The relationship between the independent and dependent variable is linear.\n",
        "\n",
        "Independence: The observations and errors are independent of each other.\n",
        "\n",
        "Homoscedasticity: The variance of errors remains constant across all levels of the independent variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "Normality of Errors: The residuals (errors) follow a normal distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "No Omitted Variables: The model is correctly specified and includes all relevant predictors.\n",
        "\n",
        "If these assumptions are violated, the accuracy and reliability of the model may decrease.\n",

        "\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "- A simple example of using simple linear regression is predicting house prices based on the size of the house. Here, the independent variable (x) is the size of the house in square feet, and the dependent variable (y) is the price. The regression model can estimate how much the price increases for every additional square foot of area. This helps property dealers and buyers estimate a reasonable market price.\n",

        "Answer:\n",
        "- The method of least squares is used to find the best-fitting line for the given data points. It works by minimizing the sum of the squared differences between the observed values and the predicted values.\n",

        "\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "- Logistic Regression is a statistical method used for classification problems, where the dependent variable is categorical (for example, Yes/No, 0/1). It predicts the probability that an observation belongs to a particular category using a logistic function, which always gives values between 0 and 1.\n",

        "\n",
        "Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): The square root of MSE. It shows the average distance between predicted and actual values in the same units as the dependent variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Measures the average of the absolute differences between actual and predicted values. It is less sensitive to outliers compared to MSE.\n",

        "Question 8: What is the purpose of the R-squared metric in regression analysis?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "- R-squared (R²) measures how well the regression model explains the variation in the dependent variable. It shows the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "Formula:\n",
        "R² = 1 – (Sum of Squared Residuals / Total Sum of Squares)\n",
        "\n",
        "The value of R² ranges between 0 and 1. A higher R² indicates that the model fits the data better. However, it does not necessarily mean that the model is the best or that the relationship is causal."
